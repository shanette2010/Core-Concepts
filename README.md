### Core-Concepts ###

While reading the trailwind document. I was very interested in the part about **Responsive Design**.

It focused alot on five breakpoints by default, inspired by common device resolutions.
  * sm
  * md
  * lg
  * xl
  * 2xl

With these certain breakpoint, all you need to do is prefix the utility with the breakpoint name, followed by ':' the character.
Which can work with every utility class in the framework. Meaning it can literally change any at a given breakpoint even things like letter spacing or course styles.
This will insure the capablility across differnet browers, allowing specific features or apply custom styles to optimize the layout for various devices and screen sizes!
